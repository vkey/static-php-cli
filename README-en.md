[![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.5.2-green.svg)]()
![Build Actions](https://github.com/crazywhalecc/static-php-cli/actions/workflows/build-php.yml/badge.svg)

## Compilation Requirements

- Supporting architecture: `x86_64`, `arm64(aarch64)`, `armv7(armv7l)` 
- Docker required (or alpine linux 3.13+)
- PHP version from 7.2 to 8.1
- Micro Package requires PHP >= 8.0

## Runtime Requirements

Linux

## Usage

1. Directly download static binary from this link or [Actions uploaded artifacts](https://github.com/crazywhalecc/static-php-cli/actions).

<https://dl.zhamao.xin/php-bin/file/>

2. Use fast install script `install-runtime.sh` to download static php and composer distribution into `runtime/` directory

But this script has some Chinese comments and prompts, if you cannot understand or have to use it in English, I will make an pure international version! :)

```bash
bash -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crazywhalecc/static-php-cli/master/install-runtime.sh`"
```

## Packing PHP Code into a Static Binary

From v1.5.0, we support packing PHP code into a static binary. You can pack your PHP code into a static binary by micro.

You can directly download `micro-` prefix file, untar it and you will get file `micro.sfx`.

Here's a simple example to use it:

```bash
echo "<?php echo 'Hello world' . PHP_EOL;" > code.php
cat micro.sfx code.php > single-app && chmod +x single-app
./single-app

# If packing phar into a static binary, just change code.php to your phar path.
```
> Note: It means that your PHP code won't be compiled and you can't protect your source code by using micro!
>
> If you are looking for compiling PHP code or encrypting code, here's not your solution.

## Compiling

Here's help command to compile it yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crazywhalecc/static-php-cli.git
cd static-php-cli/docker
docker build -t static-php . --build-arg USE_BACKUP_ADDRESS=yes
# Making a directory to put binary files
mkdir dist
# It will ask you for PHP version, extensions, and compile static binaries
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/dist:/dist/ -it static-php build-php
```

After compilation you can use command to get static php binary file.

```bash
cd dist
file ./php
```

If you don't want to use docker, a single script for compiling in **Alpine Linux**:

```bash
cd docker
# Change PHP Version
export VER_PHP="8.1.7"
# Use Original download link (Default is China mainland mirror link, for others please use 'yes' for original link)
export USE_BACKUP="yes"
./fast-compiler.sh
```

To customize PHP extensions, edit `docker/extensions.txt` file, and rules below:
- Use `^` as deselect, to mark not install. Use `#` as comments.
- extensions name uses lower case, and default file contains all supported extensions, if u need other extensions, consider write an Issue

## Customization
- If you are going to run without prompt, Just add it to the end of `docker run xxx` cmd according to the parameters given below.

> 1st parameter `original` represents that you are using global original download address to fetch dependencies, if you are in mainland China, use `mirror`.
> 
> 2nd parameter `8.1.7` is your PHP version you are compiling.
> 
> 3rd parameter `all` represents that you will compile all supported extensions.
> 
> 4th parameter `/dist/` is your binary output directory.
> 
> For example, `docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/dist:/dist/ -it static-php build-php original 8.1.7 all /dist/`

- `docker/extensions.txt` edit extensions.
- `docker/compile-php.sh` file `php_compile_args` function to adjust PHP configure arguments.
- `docker/check-extensions.sh` file `check_in_configure` function to adjust extensions' configure arguments.
- `docker/config.json` edit extensions and dependencies version and download links.

## Current Issue
- [X] Not support event(libevent), because of its `config.m4` and code.
- [ ] Swoole not support `--enable-swoole-curl`.
- [X] Not support readline, maybe caused by ncurses library.
- [X] Not support curl (solved)
- [X] Customize extensions to compile
- [X] php.ini integration
- [X] i18n (including README and scripts)
